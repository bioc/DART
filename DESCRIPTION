Description: Denoising Algorithm based on Relevance network Topology
        (DART) is an algorithm designed to evaluate the consistency of
        prior information molecular signatures (e.g in-vitro
        perturbation expression signatures) in independent molecular
        data (e.g gene expression data sets). If consistent, a pruning
        network strategy is then used to infer the activation status of
        the molecular signature in individual samples.
